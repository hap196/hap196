## Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Hailey

I'm an undergraduate at MIT studying Computer Science. Currently, I'm building Folio, an ed-tech web/mobile app and startup! I'm passionate about building tech products, particularly in the education sector -- I love being able to see the impact my own friends, classmates, and younger sister. This summer, I'm also a Software Engineer Intern at MITRE. Checkout my [portfolio](www.hpan.dev)!
